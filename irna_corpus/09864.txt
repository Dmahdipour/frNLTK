The anti-Iran measures have also impeded supply of food and medicine.The Hague-based court also ordered the US to lift barriers on the way of exports of medicine, medical equipment, food, and airplanes and the spare parts to Iran, as well as the related examinations and guarantees the respective financial transactions.Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Mohammad-Javad Zarif said on July 16 that Iran has filed a lawsuit with the ICJ for the sanctions Washington had imposed on Iran in May.Tehran argued the measure violates Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights between the two countries signed in 1955.The treaty comprising of an introduction and 23 articles was signed in Tehran and ratified by then Iranian government. The government was permitted to exchange the related documents, following ratification by Iran&#39;s National Consultative Assembly. Tehran&#39;s lawsuits against Washington concern the verdicts that the US courts have issued on the terrorist accusations against Iran being implemented in other countries, as well as the withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions, said Laya Joneidi, Iranian Deputy President for legal affairs prior to ICJ&#39;s hearing sessions.If the Hague-based court issues a verdict in favor of Iran, it will be likely that all other courts across the world follow the judgment, the Iranian official predicted.However, it is probable that the US courts, despite the ICJ verdict, still pursue their own decision, but in any case, the judgment will bear international implications for Washington, she said.The International Court of Justice is the main judicial body of the United Nations that settles the disputes between member states according to the international law and gives advisory information on queries referred to it from UN and specialized agencies.If the ICJ, in case of the unilateral withdrawal, rules in favor of Iran, the country&#39;s position will be strengthened, the Iranian deputy president said, adding that it will be much more difficult for the US to press the companies and countries to stop their cooperation with Tehran.The ruling will also be a solid legal justification for the companies that wary of doing business with Iran, Joneidi said.She argued although Iran and the US have had no diplomatic relations over the past 40 years, the 1955 treaty is still valid since neither of the two sides has officially declared any withdrawal from it.She also noted that the treaty has been cited frequently at Iran–United States Claims Tribunal and the American courts.Iran&#39;s Ambassador to the Netherlands Alireza Jahangiri had earlier said that if the ruling of the ICJ is in favor of Iran, the UN Security Council is responsible for its execution, but the US can veto the ruling.'If so, the US can be pressured through public opinion,' Jahangiri said.9156**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
