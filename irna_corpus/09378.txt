{"onTitr":"","titr":" Hague verdict should become tool of diplomacy to force US","describe":" Tehran, on Oct 3, IRNA -- the International Court of Justice verdict against the US is the success of diplomacy and the ruling discourse of Iran in the field of foreign affairs, which according to Seyyed Davood Aqaei, professor of international law at Tehran University, in addition to proving Iran&#39;s legitimacy and a global consensus against the US, is a good opportunity for the promotion of diplomacy against the United States.", "text":"Despite the vacancy in the guarantee operation of the Hague verdict, many observers consider the incident to be politically valuable, which will lead to a confusion in the face of the United States and the improvement of the image of Iran in the international system.Aqai, emphasizing that the Hague ruling is binding, but does not have a guarantee, has said about the various aspects of the issuance of the decree: at a glance, this issue can be examined from a number of perspectives: First, whether Iran can expect the United States to comply with the Hague Court&#39;s order to suspend the sanctions? The answer is no.Another issue is the advantages and the positive effects this ruling will have on the Islamic Republic of Iran in the international community, as it changes attitudes in the world towards Iran. The verdict will indicate that the United States is a country that violates international obligations and imposed sanctions on Iran illegally. This can be seen as a positive aspect of the Hague ruling, because it can condemn the United States as a violator of international law and a country that does not comply with global commitments and decides unilaterally.Professor of Law, while emphasizing that the United States has already abandoned various international obligations,  said disregarding the verdict of The Hague ruling considered a good opportunity to isolate the country as much as possible, adding, 'At the moment, the United States is accused or convicted in the International Court of Justice, which must adhere to a court order.' This shows that the United States has violated some of the rules of international law like the JCPOA, Security Council Resolution 2231 and the 1955 Contracts Agreement are examples.9455**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
