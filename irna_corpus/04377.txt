'The enemy is afraid of sanctions and boycott for different reasons,' he said, adding that one of the reasons is that the enemy will have to tolerate huge economic losses and secondly is that this can affect the public opinion and show the true face of the Zionist regime.'Israel has so far been able to establish its false narration in the world and our narration has been totally lost.'Saying that a lot can be achieved through sanctioning Israel, he said, 'This has already started in some western countries; some people have boycotted the Zionist regime as a criminal.' He said, 'What we should do is to create an Islamic-Arab-world network to sanction whatever pertaining to the Zionist regime so as to make it lose its legitimacy.'He also said any organization or union cutting its ties with the Zionist regime is a heavy blow on the regime and added that committees have been set up in the Zionists&#39; foreign affairs and intelligence ministries to counter the move.'He added that the Zionist regime has distributed hundreds of millions of dollars among university professors and media activists to counter the global movement of sanctioning Israel and to check the effect that the voice may leave.'The Zionist regime cannot stand on its own feet; it is in dire need of unlimited help from the West, especially the US.'Regarding the art and cultural sanctions, he said that in as much as they are the watchdogs they will sanction whatever related to the Zionist regime, including art and culture.They sanctioned Wonder Woman movie in Lebanon because the actress of the movie was Miss Israel who served in the army to encourage the soldiers to kill people in Gaza; then some other countries Tunisia, Jordan, Palestine, and some other countries followed them.He said that BDS also sanctioned a Palestinian woman director who received financial aid from the minister of culture of Israel, and also a Lebanese director who went to the Occupied Lands to make a movie, regardless of their nationality.Pressing Shakira, the Colombian vocalist, BDS made her cancel her concert in Tel Aviv, he said.Sokarriya also slammed some Lebanese authorities who stay clear of the phrase 'Occupying regime' and use only 'Israel' instead.9417**1420**2050Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
