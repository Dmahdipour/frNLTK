Iranian missiles are descending just near the American forces and “they are calling us desperately asking for operating at least a direct phone line between us and them so that each time Iran wants to target the terrorists, the Americans will be informed,” the general said.      Today the US is on its path to decline and it has no time been so much weak and powerless, he added. He said that the Americans have spent as much as an amount equivalent to 100 years of Iran’s oil revenues [in the region], but they admit that they have gained nothing.“They failed to get their wishes in Syria; Iraq is not in their control; they could not prevent the growth of Hezbollah in Lebanon; failed to save Saudi Arabia from the Yemeni stalemate; the security of the Zionist regime is becoming weaker day after another; they failed to break the resistance of the Iranian nation; couldn’t keep their allies, and some of them leaned towards Iran; even failed to keep the accompaniment of Europe, and their cold war with Russia has begun once again,” General Salami said.    9341**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
