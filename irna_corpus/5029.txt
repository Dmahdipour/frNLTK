Al-Jazeera TV channel announced on Sunday morning Khashoggi&#39;s body was found on a street in Istanbul, Turkey.Turkish detectives and police point the finger of blame at Saudi Arabia, as the journalist had entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last Tuesday to collect documents for his forthcoming marriage with his fianc&#233;e, Khadijah Azro, but never left the mission building.Azro told the Turkish media on Wednesday her fianc&#233; had gone to Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last week to get a document for their marriage.She said her fianc&#233;e was 'kidnapped' by the government of Saudi Arabia and it should be held accountable for his killing.Despite Arab media&#39;s silence over Donald Trump&#39;s frequent insults, Jamal Khashoggi, who was an outspoken critic of Saudi government, sharply criticized the rulers of Saudi Arabia two weeks ago after Trump&#39;s speech at UN General Assembly.In his speech at United Nations General Assembly on September 25, US president explicitly said Washington expects other countries (Saudi Arabia) 'to pay their fair share' for US military support.9477**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
