The Shah&#39;s regime and the US were, back then, friends, but following the 1979 revolution in Iran, friends turned into arch-enemies. Iran discontinued its nuclear program after the revolution, but Iran-Iraq war (1988-1989) changed the equilibrium. Tehran continues to emphasize its nuclear program is civil, though.Vincent Eiffling, French researcher and scholar, has pointed to the US pulling out of the landmark deal known commonly as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saying the president of the United States has given reasons to justify ditching Iran deal.One reason is what Trump considers 'sunset provisions'. The US president wants the deal to outlast his term.Iran is among the signatories to the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, according to which non-nuclear-weapon states have the right to access the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology, Eiffling said.The 2015 nuclear deal has imposed constraints on Iran&#39;s nuclear program and Trump wants to reach a consensus so as to limit Tehran in this regard.Iran reaffirms its nuclear program is exclusively being used for peaceful purposes.Europe strives to save the deal and it has pledged to provide mechanisms that would ensure Iranâ€™s continued benefits from the nuclear pact.   9477**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
