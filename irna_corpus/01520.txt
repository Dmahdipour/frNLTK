He had positive and encouraging discussions with his Indian counterpart Mrs. Sushma Swaraj and held bilateral high level deliberations.'He further stressed that during the visit, both sides decided to expand cooperation in all segments of their bilateral ties especially in energy, banking, transportation and commerce.”“The visit built on the achievements of the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s state visit to India in Feb, 2018. The most significant takeaway of the visit was the categorical and unambiguous declaration by Mrs. Sushma Swaraj that India will abide by only the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (UN) and not by those imposed by any individual country like the USA,” added Amb. Ashok Sajjander, also president of the Delhi-Based think tank Institute of Global Studies.On the possible ways for Iran and India to avoid the US unilateral sanctions on Iran and to continue their bilateral trade ties, the Ambassador said: “India will try to convince the USA that its projects of collaboration with Iran like Chabahar, International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and its oil imports from Iran should not come under the purview of either the secondary sanctions under the Iran nuclear deal or the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) which came into effect in August, 2017. India is hopeful of getting such an exception as it was able to obtain a waiver from the USA last time also.'Commenting on other possible areas of cooperation between the two countries, he said: 'Chabahar is both a commercial and strategic port and will provide alternative access to India to reach Afghanistan to engage in trade and investment with that country, thereby, providing a spur to economic growth and development there. Chabahar also provides access to Central Asia which is important for India to enhance and further diversify its ties with this increasingly important and strategic region.''We could also look to trading with each other in our own currencies. Also, Indian companies could extensively use the special provisions made last year whereby, they can invest in Iran in Indian Rupees,' added the seasoned Indian diplomat.Elaborating on the possible ways to establish an alternative international banking system to counter the US hegemony over the present one, he said: “The world is increasingly becoming a multi-polar one. The center of gravity is rapidly moving towards Asia from the transatlantic region. The newly emerging economies and middle powers should get together and ensure that the existing financial and banking system is used in a balanced and fair manner and not against the interests of other economies.'Any change in the existing system should be made after full and detailed consultations and by consensus in a step by step manner. It should not be undertaken in a manner which will cause disruption in international trade or global economic exchanges and investments.”1434**1396Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
