Some Iraqi media had quoted Akbari as saying that upon an order by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, Tehran had decided to block some 7 mcm waters on Iranian western and northwestern borders running into Iraq. The news was widely circulated in Iraqi social networks, as well as regional and international media. It is not possible for Iran to cut so much flow of water into Iraq without coordination as such issues fall under the already signed agreements between the two countries, including, Algeria 1975 Accord, Alizadeh Tabatabaei said.  He said that actually Iran has plans to allocate two billion dollars to change the path of central rivers in Sistan and Balouchestan Province, noting that the bordering rivers are not on the agenda. The media misquotations of Akbari may be due to wrong translation or misinterpretation, the ambassador said.  Over the past few months, some media have been seizing the opportunity to launch propaganda to harm relations between Iran and Iraq. Analysts have warned that such suspicious measures may heighten on the eve of Arbaeen rituals, during which millions of Shia Muslims congretate in Iraq annually.  9341**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
