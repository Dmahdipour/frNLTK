{"onTitr":"","titr":" IAEA rejects Israeli PM anti-Iran request","describe":" Tehran, Oct 2, IRNA – The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a statement rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s request for inspecting Iran nuclear program again.", "text":"Addressing the UNGA meeting, Netanyahu claimed that Iran has a nuclear warehouse in Turquzabad, south of Tehran, which has been hidden to the IAEA inspectors.'The Agency implements safeguards in accordance with its rights and obligations deriving from the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements and the Additional Protocols concluded between the Agency and States, relevant IAEA Board of Governors and the UN Security Council decisions and resolutions, and based on the Agency’s established safeguards practices. It should be noted that under the existing verification framework the Agency sends inspectors to sites and locations only when needed,' the statement reads.'The Agency uses all safeguards relevant information available to it but it does not take any information at face value. In line with established safeguards practices, all information obtained, including from third parties, is subject to rigorous review and assessed together with other available information to arrive at an independent assessment based on the Agency’s own expertise. It is not the practice of the Agency to publicly discuss issues related to any such information,' it added.'The Agency’s work related to nuclear verification is and must always be impartial, factual, and professional. In order to maintain credibility, the Agency’s independence in relation to the implementation of verification activities is of paramount importance.''The Agency’s verification activities in Iran are being carried out based on the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA) concluded with Iran and the Additional Protocol, that Iran is provisionally implementing. In addition, the Agency is also carrying out verification and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These activities will continue to be carried out within the parameters of the relevant decisions and resolutions of the IAEA Board of Governors and the UN Security Council as appropriate.''As I stated in my reports to the IAEA Board of Governors, evaluations regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities for Iran remain ongoing. The Agency continues to evaluate Iran’s declarations under the Additional Protocol, and has conducted complementary accesses under the Additional Protocol to all the sites and locations in Iran which it needed to visit.'Iran&#39;s foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi earlier said that the claims made by the Zionist regime&#39;s prime minister against Iran&#39;s nuclear program did not deserve a response.The ridiculous show and allegations were predictable as long as Benjamin Netanyahu was concerned.Earlier on Friday, Iran&#39;s envoy to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) reacted to Netanyahu&#39;s unfounded allegations by saying that Iran is watching &#39;Israel’s criminal behavior whenever they do it wherever they do it.&#39;Meanwhile, the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a message urged the Zionist regime of Israel to admit to and open its &#39;undeclared&#39; nuclear arsenal to the UN inspectors.&#39;No arts &amp; craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons program - including an *actual atomic arsenal*,&#39; said Zarif in a tweet on September 28 with a reference to the allegations made by the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly.9376**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
