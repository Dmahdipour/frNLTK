He also claimed Kerry has told Zarif 'to wait out this administration'.Current US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, also accused Kerry of undermining Washington&#39;s policies toward Iran and called the visits 'inappropriate and unprecedented'. Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammd Javad Zarif confirmed the meetings at Munich Security Conference, saying, the topic of the meetings was mostly US President&#39;s policies on the JCPOA and how to react to his policies so as to isolate him both in the United States and around the world.Trump announced early in May Washington would leave the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, re-imposing unilateral sanctions against the country, a move which drew strong condemnation on national and international levels. 9477**2044Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
