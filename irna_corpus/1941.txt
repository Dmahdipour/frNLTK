Panzeri described Khashoggi as a human rights activist and said his articles on persistent violations of human rights in Saudi Arabia could be among the reasons he went missing. The DROI chair said the European Parliament&#39;s Subcommittee on Human Rights closely monitors the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, and urged Riyadh to free prisoners of conscience and political prisoners, in particular civil rights activists.The killing of the Saudi journalist will further increase the European Parliament&#39;s concerns over Saudi Arabia&#39; human rights record, he went on to say.In the same vein, the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, called for a comprehensive investigation into the case.'We expect a thorough investigation and full transparency from the Saudi authorities on what has happened,' Mogherini said at a press conference on Tuesday.The 59-year-old Saudi illustrious journalist, who had left the country since Bin Salman was named Crown Prince and moved to the US, disappeared last Tuesday after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to collect documents for his forthcoming marriage.In his articles which were published by the Washington Post, Khashoggi sharply rebuked Saudi Arabia&#39;s war in Yemen, financial crisis between Saudi Arabia and Canada and arresting women&#39;s rights activists.9477**2050Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
