'The Palestinian people and leadership will not be intimidated and will not succumb to coercion. The rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale,' Ashrawi said.'There is no glory in constantly bullying and punishing people under occupation. The US administration has already demonstrated meanness of spirit in its collusion with the Israeli occupation and its theft of land and resources….now it is exercising economic meanness by punishing the Palestinian victims of this occupation,' she added.Earlier the European Union announced that after the US cutting aids to UNRWA, the European Union allocated €40m to the agency.'We will add €40 million to our financing to @UNRWA on top of the funding we are already providing [..] We will continue to invest in that because we think this is a key, not only humanitarian duty, but also investment in the two state solution,&#39; the European External Action Service (EEAS) quoted the European Union’s Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini as saying in UNRWA ministerial meeting and Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting.9376**2044Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
