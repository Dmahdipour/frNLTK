'I think that changing the status in bypassing the Security Council would be a direct violation of these resolutions,' he added.Israel took control over the Golan Heights that had belonged by Syria from 1944 after the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1981, Israel’s Knesset (parliament) passed a law on the Golan Heights unilaterally proclaiming Israel’s sovereignty over this territory. United Nations Security Council Resolution 497 of December 17, 1981 ruled that the annexation was null and void, having no international legal effect.The Israeli leadership has repeatedly said the Golan Heights will forever remain under the control of the  Zionist regime. On Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39; claims that Israel would continue its fight against the presence of Iran and its allied groups in Syria, Lavrov said Russia prefers that all foreign players who are somehow engaged in  Syria crisis first of all follow the goal of helping the Syrian leadership eradicate terrorism in that country as underlined in the UNSC resolution 2254.The prime minister of the Zionist regime recently said he intended to meet and confer with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the possibility of international recognition of its sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Iran&#39;s presence  in Syria and Tel Aviv&#39;s decision to counter this danger.The Russian foreign minister also said the establishment of a demilitarized zone in Idleb might be postponed.The Presidents of Russia  and Turkey Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan  agreed last month in Russian resort city of Sochi  to establish a demilitarized zone in Syria’s Idlib region, the last major stronghold of anti-government rebels .The zone will be 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) deep, with troops from Russia and NATO-member Turkey conducting coordinated patrols.1396**1396Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
