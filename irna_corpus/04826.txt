Al-Jazeera TV channel announced on Sunday morning Khashoggi&#39;s body was found on a street in Istanbul, Turkey.Despite Arab media&#39;s silence over Donald Trump&#39;s repeated insults, Jamal Khashoggi, who was an outspoken critic of Saudi government, sharply criticized the rulers of Saudi Arabia especially the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, two weeks ago after Trump&#39;s speech at UN General Assembly. In his speech at United Nations General Assembly on September 25, US president explicitly said Washington expects other countries (Saudi Arabia) 'to pay their fair share' for US military support.Following Trump&#39;s offensive speech, Khashoggi tweeted, every now and then Trump writes on Twitter he supports Arab countries, and we, Arabs, must pay for US support. But the question which comes to my mind is who does the president of the United States support us against?He had also said he believes the biggest danger threatening Arab countries and their oil resources is Trump himself, since he sees the Arabs as oil wells.9477**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
