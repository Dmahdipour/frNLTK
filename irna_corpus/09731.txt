The international body emphasized that the order is binding and imperative, and said the US must remove the impediments on the way of Iran&#39;s trade in particular spheres in line with its international obligations.The ICJ has also reiterated the importance of Resolution 2231of the UN Security Council that was issued in confirmation of the nuclear deal.  Tehran has also hailed the order that neutralized the US attempts for rejecting the jurisdiction of the court aimed at shrugging off its legal obligations.In the order, the judiciary body has said that the global public opinion and all independent countries are more determined in displaying their will for respecting international agreements, legal law and the governments&#39; responsibilities under the nuclear deal, the statement of Iran&#39;s foreign ministry added.The ruling showed once more that this is the US government that is increasingly being isolated due to its wrong, extremist policies and greed in dealing with other countries, it said.9156**2044Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
