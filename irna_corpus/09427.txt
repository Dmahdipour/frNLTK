Referring to the US unilateral exit from Iran nuclear deal – formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – President Rouhani said that an absolute majority of the countries supported the pact and hailed Iran’s staying in the contract, while they condemned the US sanctions against Iran as an illegal measure. The US violation of its international commitments, and its opposition to some international bodies, including the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, as well as Washington’s withdrawal from some trade pacts were criticized by all the countries, Rouhani said. “While the West, particularly the US, always made every effort in the United Nations to introduce Iran as a country which violates the international regulations so as to isolate it, this time, exactly the contrary occurred.” The US aimed to anyhow begin a type of negotiation with Iran at any level so as to announce they could bring the country to negotiating table by exerting pressure, the president said. The European countries and the five countries still staying in the deal struck with Iran in 2015, took an important decision on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly session, President Rouhani said, adding that they approved and announced a special financial body for interaction with Iran which has angered the Americans. However, he said that Iran expects much more and wants its economic relations to completely return to normal conditions.  He said that Americans sought to make an achievement against Iran in the UN Security Council, but to no avail.All the other 14 countries, that spoke in the Security Council session, supported JCPOA either directly or indirectly and the method and performance of the US were not confirmed by anyone, and even some member states openly criticized the crimes and violations of the US, President Rouhani said. The UN Security Council convened on September 26 to consider Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction where the US president, who chaired the meeting, used harsh comments about Iran that were not welcomed by other member states, and the United States seemed lonelier than ever in the meeting.    9341**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
