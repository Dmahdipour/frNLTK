According to the IRGC, the attacks killed around 40 terrorists.'The all-out war will naturally carry on because the enemy is trying hard to push the war into Iran – by both supporting the terror groups and creating discontent through sanctions and economic pressures,' said Jome&#39;e.Saying that Iran is really wise, he said, 'Iran knows when and where to respond the enemy. Sometimes the responses are not overt and, as strategic observers say like chess, there are some covert moves which only the enemy catches.''Iran&#39;s missile attack was a power show case.'IRGC missiles were shot in response to the terror attack made in Ahvaz, southwestern Iran, on September 22. At least 25 people, including women and children, were killed and more than 60 others injured in the attack which took place during a military parade held to mark the 38th anniversary of the eight-year (1980-88) war imposed on Iran. The self-proclaimed Saudi-affiliated Al-Ahwaz terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack.Regarding the show put up at the United Nations General Assembly by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about missile centers in south of Lebanon, the Lebanese parliamentarian said, 'What this clown did at the UN was unveiled before long.''He always did the same thing – brought a bunch of photos, told lies, and tried to argue for them – but everyone saw that with the tour organized by the Lebanese diplomatic system, the show was a disaster.'He said that the Zionists&#39; prime minister lost face, which was a hard blow to them. Commenting about US diplomats&#39; absence on the tour, he said that neither their ambassador, nor their charg&#233; d’affaires, nor any other diplomat, even a secretary, took part in the event, which shows 'there was a scenario in progress, which was outsmarted by the Lebanese diplomatic system.'9417**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
