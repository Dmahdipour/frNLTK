The fact is that neither one of these projections is very appealing for a global community that is so heavily dependent on the fossil fuels to meet basic human needs. The bottom line: We are going to run out of fossil fuels for energy and we have no choice but to prepare for the new age of energy production since, most certainly, human demands for energy will not decrease.”“There is a great deal of information and enthusiasm today about the development and increased production of our global energy needs from alternative energy sources. Solar energy, wind power and moving water are all traditional sources of alternative energy that are making progress. The enthusiasm everyone shares for these developments has in many ways created a sense of complacency that our future energy demands will easily be met,” she added.  Warning the world community about the possible shortage of the fossil energy sources in the future to meet its energy needs, the distinguished writer said: “And here is one very important factor: population growth. As the population grows upwards towards nine billion people over the next 50 years, the world’s energy demands will increase proportionately. Not only will it be important for renewable energy to keep up with the increasing population growth, but it must outpace not only these demands but begin replacing fossil fuel energy production if we are to meet future energy needs.”Elaborating on the role of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in meeting the energy need of the world community, Barkhaa Versha said: “International Solar Alliance (ISA) can replace Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the future as the key supplier of energy for the world. The group of solar resource rich nations will have the same role that is being played by OPEC currently. The Indian Prime Minister Narednra Modi has called for connecting the solar energy supply across borders and has mooted the idea of ’One World, One Sun and One Grid.”“India will generate 40 per cent of power from non-fossil fuels by 2030. This is the right time to invest in the renewable energy because there is a possibility of 70-80 billion dollar business in the next four years in India. In India, where we are going to see global renewable energy revolution, solar energy is at the centre of this revolution.”Terming the renewable energy resources as the only ways to save the nature, she said, “Many developed countries have been making concentrated efforts to develop renewable energy sources. I strongly believe that it should be the main alternative to fossil fuels. In Japan, power from the nuclear generation is less expensive than power generated from oil. Furthermore, climate change and escalating oil prices have persuaded some countries that had adopted a cautious stance toward nuclear energy to change their minds and seriously consider it as an alternative.”“In view of the expected increase in global energy needs and of environmental concerns, we need to make rapid progress in energy efficiency and further develop a broad range of clean alternative energy sources to reduce emissions and solve climate change problems. Humankind shares a common destiny. I hope that technological progress and policy action on alternative energy for transportation will benefit society and lead us on the road to sustainability, in harmony with nature for a long and bright future for humanity.”1424**1420            "}
