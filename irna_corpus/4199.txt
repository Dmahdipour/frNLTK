{"onTitr":"","titr":" Report: Tears of 'bin Salman' for Khashoggi deceptive","describe":" Tehran, Oct 8, IRNA - The Arabic-language Al-Monitor reported that never might be known what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic of the Saudi government, but the tears of &#39;Mohamed bin Salman&#39; for him are just lies and deceptive.", "text":"'We may never know exactly what happened to Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and the crown prince&#39;s tears are likely to be false and deceptive,' said Bruce Riddle, a senior manager at Brookings.Turkey&#39;s sources say the Khashoggi was killed on October 2 in the Saudi consulate and his body was sent secretly to Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, the Saudis have allowed the Turkish authorities to look for Khashoggi in the consulate, which suggests he was killed or kidnapped alive by the Saudi security services.According to this member of the Brookings think-tank, there is never any doubt about the loyalty of this Saudi journalist to his country. He was known for a long time as the right hand of the Prince of Turkiye al-Faisal, the head of the Saudi intelligence agency, who later became ambassador to Britain and the United States. He has also been critical of his country&#39;s policies. Khashoggi went to the United States when he faced Saudi warnings of criticism against the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. His last column for the Washington Post was about the policy of Prince Mohammed bin Salman: &#39;War in Yemen&#39;. The young crown prince who is also the country&#39;s defense minister is among those who have launched the war against the Houthis in Yemen. This prince, however, is sensitive about criticism, especially with regard to criticizing him about the Yemeni war that caused the worst human disasters in the world and led to undermining the Kingdome.9455**2050Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
