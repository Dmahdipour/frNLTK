He said Pakistan’s relations with Iran started out well after the country gained independence.The analyst noted Pakistan was encouraged to join a regional economic association that also included Iran and Turkey. “The Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) was intended to bring economic progress to the three countries that were on the periphery of the Soviet Empire. All three were non-Arab members of the Muslim world,” said the expert. Shahid Javed Burki went on to say that during the campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump threatened to pull his country out of the nuclear deal President Barack Obama had negotiated with Iran in 2015. He added as President Hassan Rouhani put it in an article contributed to The Washington Post on September 23, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) “had been achieved after 12 years of tough, intensive negotiations.” China, France, Germany and the European Union had also signed. The analyst said the Zionist regime had opposed the agreement and was probably behind Trump’s promise to scuttle it, which he did soon after assuming office. “During the campaign, he had called the treaty the worst ever the United States had entered into with a foreign nation,” he said. Trump did not stop with the cancellation of his country’s participation in the arrangement.Shahid Javed Burki added that Iranian president responding to anti-Iran tweet of Donald Trump said that a confrontation with his country would be “the mother of all wars” and suggested that Tehran might flex its military might in the Middle Eastern waterways that are crucial to global commerce, in particular the flow of oil to the West.He said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the nuclear deal, posted a tweet also using capital letters and sending a similar warning as the one delivered by President Trump. He said Trump has recently addressed the United Nations General Assembly in which his claim that he was about to complete the two most successful years in the history of the American presidency, drew a laugh from the hall in which sat the representatives of most world nations. The analyst went on to say that despite all international developments, the new government in Pakistan under Prime Minister Imran Khan must continue to have strong working relationship with Iran. 272**6125**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
