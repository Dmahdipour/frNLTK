That’s a bold strategy. Let’s see if it pays off for them.”Some details of this internal battle were first reported by the Washington Post ahead of the European visit. The Post identified Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as the Treasury official leading the battle to save Iran.Congressional leaders are said to be aware of this effort to save Iran’s access to SWIFT and are pushing back with force.Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), both vocal anti-Iran leaders, told the Free Beacon through spokesmen that Congress will not go along with efforts to protect Iran’s financial access, despite pressure from some inside the Trump administration“Ultimately, SWIFT and the Europeans must choose between doing business with the United States or Iran,” a Cotton spokesman told the Free Beacon. “Those attempting to use a creative backchannel to facilitate commerce with Iran would do well to remember that the $19 trillion US economy dwarfs Iran’s, which is approximately the size of Maryland’s.”Cruz and other allies in the Senate have repeatedly warned European allies and SWIFT leaders--which includes US-based banks JPMorgan and Citibank--that Congress will not hesitate to sanction any institution or government that breaches the new US sanctions.A showdown on SWIFT is now likely, particularly as Iran pursues a greater number of economic partnerships across the globe.“In July, Senator Cruz and nine fellow senators sent a letter to European ambassadors emphasizing that sanctions like the ones regarding SWIFT are the result of congressional statutes, and Congress expects our allies will comply with them,” a Cruz spokesman told the Free Beacon.“In August, he and 15 fellow senators sent a letter to the Treasury Department emphasizing the importance of enforcing SWIFT-related restrictions, because otherwise the President’s maximum pressure campaign will fail,” the spokesman said. “Everything that’s happened since then has confirmed those positions.”The Treasury Department did not respond to Free Beacon requests for comment on the matter.One former sanctions official who worked extensively on the Iranian portfolio told the Free Beacon that while some may be angling to save Iran’s access to SWIFT, it remains mostly in the president’s hands.“It’s basically up to the president at this point,” said the former official, who would only speak on background. “There’s a big push by SWIFT to get opinion leaders to side with Iran and Europe, but Trump knows how weak he will look if he doesn’t get them to disconnect. He can’t have a policy weaker than Barack Obama’s for crying out loud.”8072**1396Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
