It was prevalent in the Iranian plateau and the Indian subcontinent for successive centuries.However, it has gone grave changes in status and importance in the subcontinent in recent decades due to certain political transformations in India.Gradually, other languages have gained momentum by scholars and statesmen in India and new ones have emerged like Urdu which is a deviation of Persian.
