{"onTitr":" French political researcher:    ","titr":" Comparing Iran, North Korea wrong","describe":" Tehran, Oct 6, IRNA - Political scientist at the University of Lyon, France, pointing to the United States&#39; unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal (JCPOA), said the comparison between Tehran and Pyongyang is completely wrong.", "text":"Vincent Afling said that while John bolton, the US National Security Advisor, had been seriously following the plan to change Iran&#39;s sovereignty before appointment, he now says that the ultimate goal of Washington is not to change Tehran&#39;s system.He said the United States and Donald Trump are trying to dictate North Korea&#39;s pattern to Iran. North Korea is currently following the same pattern that Trump hopes to use against Iran.The researcher at the University of Lyon, France, says that Washington wants to put Iran under the sanctions and then launch a major public diplomacy campaign that leads to a meeting between leaders of the two countries.A year ago, at the UN General Assembly, Trump convinced the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to negotiate in June 2018 and urged him to negotiate a nuclear disarmament which is currently no guarantee to accept it.Afling says the resemblance between Iran and North Korea is very small for two reasons. The first reason is very simple: North Korea, which has repeatedly tested nuclear material, is now considered a nuclear power. The second reason is simple; in the case of Iran, there is an agreement reached by the majority of the international community and other signatories to this agreement have no desire to have a new agreement. In particular, the IAEA has repeatedly stated that Iran is committed to its nuclear commitments.Since the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal, US European allies are also united with the United States to punish Pyongyang, but they reject the interruption of relations with Iran. But some observers believe that America without the Europeans will never succeed in putting pressure on Tehran to bring it to its knees.Confronting US sanctions against Iran has become a major challenge for European countries. In response to the same issue last week, they announced a specific mechanism for continuing to trade with Iran, in particular buying oil from Iran and bypassing US sanctions.The European Union has already activated the mechanism that had been set up in 1996 to circumvent US sanctions against Cuba.9455**2050Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
