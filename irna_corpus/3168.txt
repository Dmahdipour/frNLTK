'The Trump administration has yet to reach a final conclusion on how to treat Iranian commercial banks,' FT added.'Hardliners within the [US] administration and on Capitol Hill who are close to Trump plan to renew their campaign to isolate Iran entirely from Swift in the final run-up to November 5.'He said that the US could issue visa bans and asset freezes of Swift’s board members and pursue charges and fines against its member banks.The UK and French finance ministers are due to meet in Mnuchin at the IMF meetings, as is Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commission vice-president responsible for financial services policy, FT wrote.  European diplomats are also pressing the US to exempt Swift from transactions penalties on humanitarian grounds, to ensure the provision of food and other non-sanctionable consumer goods to the Iranian people.SWIFT provides a network which enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized and reliable environment.9417**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
