Ayatollah Khamenei delivered a speech to the audience at the gathering. The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution-- Ayatollah Khamenei-- began his speech by referring to the upcoming Arbaeen march and asserted: The very important days come after Ashura: the days of the saga of Lady Zeinab.The Leader of the Revolution addressed the audience on the coming of the Arbaeen and said: Arbaeen is around the corner. Our nation, the Iraqi nation and many people from other nations are making the arrangements for the great saga of Arbaeen.Ayatollah Khamenei mentioned that the Iranian and Iraqi nations are preparing themselves for the magnificent Arbaeen march of millions of believers and added: On days like these days the roads from Karbala, Kufa, Levant (Shaam) towards Medina were the path on which the glorious saga of Lady Zeinab (a.s.) and Imam Sajjad (a.s.) along with other captives of Ashura unfolded with their luminous movement: these personalities managed to make the message of Ashura eternal-- make it perpetual and immortal.He went on to say: On these days, we, too, feel a stronger bond with those magnanimous martyrs in our hearts. Ayatollah Khamenei described the Arbaeen march of millions as: The Arbaeen saga is a wonderful phenomenon which has unfolded-- by the Grace and Mercy of God-- at a time when the World of Islam most needed such epic. The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution offered a summary of the points he was to deliver to the 100 thousand gathering and maintained: The gist of my speech today represents 1st, Iran’s majesty; 2nd, Islamic Republic’s sovereignty; and 3rd Iranian nation’s invincibility. These are not only some superficial slogans, like the slogans some others chant. These are facts that Iran’s enemies wish the Iranian people don&#39;t recognize, or ignore them and think otherwise about themselves and their country. But these facts are too obvious to be denied.Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that the greatness of the Iranian nation is nothing new and has been there for centuries, adding: As for the topic of Iran’s majesty, not just in the present time—rather, Iran&#39;s majesty is a historical matter through eras. Our dear country has managed to stand out proudly among Muslim nations—and in some epochs, among all nations in the world—on arenas of science, philosophy, politics, arts and humanities. This is true in our era, and at the historical eras, except for the 200 years preceding the Islamic Revolution-- that is, during the Qajar and Pahlavi regimes-- when Iran’s majesty was damaged during these reigns.“On the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic,” Ayatollah Khamenei held, “it suffices to point out that it saved Iran from the domination of UK and US; a domination that had begun in early 19th century and arrogant, merciless foreigners ruled over country&#39;s every matter.”He went on to say: For the first time in the recent century, the Islamic Republic could prevent dissolution of the country in a war. For the first time, the Iranian nation during the 8-year imposed war, managed to disappoint the extensive front of the enemy, and maintain the country’s territorial integrity.Ayatollah Khamenei described the Iranian nation as undefeatable and asserted: I pointed out to the invincibility of the Iranian nation—which is, of course, because of Islam. This invincibility can be observed in the nation&#39;s victory during the Sacred Defense against Saddam&#39;s invasion and their resistance against enemies&#39; conspiracies during 40 years.Ayatollah Khamenei praised the role the youth of the country can play in the progress and development of the nation and said: The tip of the arrow of the huge popular movement is you, the youth. The experienced elderly, if not tired and exhausted, can guide and lead; but the youth are the engine for movement; similarly, it was so in the past.The Leader of the Revolution pointed out to the many roles the youth have effectively played since the revolution and held: During forty years of struggles—during the fights against the separatists at the early years following the revolution, while making efforts for building infrastructures, in fighting against the treachery of terrorism during the early 80’s, in the fight against invaders during 8 years of Sacred Defense against Saddam’s invasion, in efforts for reconstructing the country after the war, in cultural fights of the 90’s—it was the youth who managed to change the tough situation in favor of the revolution. In the academic efforts since the early 2000’s, in combats against the Takfiri terrorism in the 2010’s and today, in intellectual and practical fights for resolving economic problems, again it is the youth who act and save the day.The leader of the revolution assured the gathering of the 100 thousand Basij members of the ongoing progress of the nation, asserting: you should not think that the path ahead is a highway with no obstacles; no! The path to progress is ahead of us, but it is a rough path with twists. There are obstacles. The enemy is fully active in opposing us. We should go through this path while surpassing the obstacles. This requires some conditions: The first step, for being able to take this road, is to recognize and understand the presence of the enemy. As long as we don’t know the enemy is there, we won’t build defensive bases to protect us. The second stage represents confidence and persistence in resistance. Weak, unconfident, opportunist people have nothing to show in this way.The third stage is about recognizing the area of the invasion. In which area is our war with the enemy taking place? We should identify that appropriately. We should understand the enemy’s threats. We should know where the enemy will first target. All the people must have a clear understanding of the realm of the fights. Ayatollah Khamenei urged the nation to develop more knowledge of the country’s capabilities in the face of enemies’ propaganda against Iran and stated: If you have an accurate understanding of the country’s facts, the enemy will be at loss. The enemies try to mislead the Iranian nation by presenting distorted images. Enemies present distorted images of Iran, of themselves and the region to pretend they are in power; while they&#39;re not in a powerful stance.”He slammed US President’s na&#239;ve thoughts on Iran, thinking the Islamic Republic would soon collapse and compared his words on Iran to those of US footmen in Iran 40 years ago. He remarked: Another extremely distorted image which is presented by them is their image of the Islamic Iran. Recently I heard that the President of the United States has said to some European leaders that, wait for two to three months; in two to three months the Islamic Republic will come to its end. Hearing that, we were reminded of the words that 40 years ago-- four decades ago-- were uttered by the same people who served the US like footmen, inside Iran; they bid one another wishful thinking by saying, wait for some six months and the Islamic Republic will fall. Six months would pass by and then they would say, wait for one more year, it will come to an end.The Leader of the Revolution touched on a Persian proverb that describes wishful thinking to demean the fancies of the Western leaders to witness the fall of Iran, stating: Today, forty years have passed by and the delicate sapling has grown into a thick tree. Yet, this miserable man bids himself and his European counterparts wishful thinking that, wait for two to three months. This reminds me of the folklore poem:Camel&#39;s dream of cotton seeds;they see themselves eating sometimes a mouthful, sometimes seed by seed.Ayatollah Khamenei acknowledged problems exist, but that the real shortcoming—which Iran is free of—is to feel having reached a dead-end, saying: Surely, we have economic problems; we have an oil economy, which is a major shortcoming. In our culture, we don’t learn and teach to save on resources; wasting resources is a shortcoming. We admit we have these shortcomings, but the real shortcoming goes beyond these. The real shortcoming is feeling stuck; which we don’t have it, thanks be to God. We don’t have a dead end [in the affairs of our country]. The real shortcoming is this. The real shortcoming is that the youth of our country think there is no solution, but to rely on enemies.Ayatollah Khamenei draw an analogy between media soft war and chemical weapons used in warfare to stress the significant hazard media manipulation of information poses on nations. He observed: Currently, the enemy is using the media tools to influence our public opinion. Media tools are important tools, and in the hands of the enemies, they are dangerous tools. Media tools are analogized to chemical weapons in military wars. Chemical weapons don’t destroy tanks or equipment, but they eliminate humans, purging the power to use the tools. Media tools work in the same way. TV, cyberspace and social networks are used against our public opinion today.He then urged officials and public opinion practitioners to heed to the matter, asserting: Those who are responsible in this area should give careful attention. I also insisted on this fact in other meetings, saying ‘these media must not turn into a means for the enemy so they can easily use their chemical weapons against our people.” The officials must understand their duty and act seriously.The leader of the Islamic Revolution reassured the crowd and the nation that Iran is on its way towards progress and development; he articulated: Based on the information I have on the status of the country, I firmly declare that this nation and the new generation has decided not to be humiliated again, not to follow foreign powers and enemies; the new generation has decided to make Iran attain the peak of honor and dignity. And they have the capability to do it.Ayatollah Khamenei finally avowed: The crowd of 100,000 here is a reminder of the crowd of 100,000 for whom I made a speech here in the late 1980s; once my speech was done, they left for the war fronts and brought about great victories for the country. And you dear youth, God willing, will be victorious and successful in the fields of science and economic movement, and entrepreneurship, in the fields of individual and teamwork as well as efforts in the field of social and cultural networking, in the required fire-at-will zones of action, and everywhere else.9156**1420Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish            "}
