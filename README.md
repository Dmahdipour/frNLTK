#frNLTK
Persian Natural Language Tool Kit 

I've commit it as First version, but it is not really first version.
It's first time that I want to upload it in Git.
My frNLTK is so uncompleted but I'm going to complete it by the time.

I appreciate it who want to join me to debug and complete it.
I glad to hear If any changes are needed.

With Regard
